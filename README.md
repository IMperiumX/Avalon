# Avalon

Avalon is a distributed file system designed to provide high availability and durability by replicating files across multiple nodes. This project aims to create a fault-tolerant system that can withstand node failures and ensure seamless file access.

## **Key Features**

* **Replication**: Files are replicated across multiple nodes to ensure durability and high availability.
* **High Availability**: The system is designed to maintain file access even in the event of node failures or additions.
* **Parallelization**: Tasks are parallelized to optimize performance and minimize latency.
* **Sharding**: Advanced sharding mechanisms are implemented to efficiently manage and store files.

## **Architecture**

Avalon consists of multiple nodes that interact with each other to provide a distributed file system. Each node is responsible for:

* **File Storage**: Storing and retrieving files.
* **Replication**: Replicating files across multiple nodes.
* **Node Management**: Managing node connections and communication.

## Design the Core Components:**

* **Node Management:**
  * **Node Registration/Discovery:** How new nodes join the system and make themselves known.
  * **Health Checks:** Periodically monitor the health of nodes.
  * **Load Balancing:** Distribute file storage and requests across nodes.
* **Data Replication and Consistency:**
  * **Replication Strategy:** Implement the 'm' out of 'n' replica policy.
  * **Consistency Model:** Decide on eventual consistency or stronger consistency guarantees. Consider using algorithms like Paxos or Raft.
* **API Design:**
  * **File Upload/Download:** Define the endpoints and protocols for clients to interact with the system.
  * **Metadata Management:** APIs for retrieving file information, listing directories, etc.
* **Parallel Processing:**
  * **Background Tasks:** Implement asynchronous processes for replication, data cleanup, and other non-blocking operations.
  * **Concurrency Model:** Use goroutines (Go), asyncio (Python), or threads (Java) to handle parallel tasks efficiently.

## 4. **Key Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** Design for fault tolerance, node failures, and network issues.
* **Security:** Implement authentication and authorization to protect data.
* **Scalability:** Plan for horizontal scalability (adding more nodes) to handle increasing load.
* **Monitoring and Logging:**  Implement robust monitoring to track system performance and identify potential issues.
